WebPages - python web framework
===

Hello.

This project is based on good ideas from **Ruby on Rails** and **Django** web frameworks. Also I wish to add asynchronous code execution like in **Tornado** and **Node.js**. I tried to simplify project structure to make project as easy as it possible. I believe that you find it useful.
