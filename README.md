WebPages - python web framework
=====

Hello.

This project is based on good ideas from **Ruby on Rails** and **Django** web frameworks. Also I wish to add asynchronous code execution like in **Tornado** and **Node.js**. I tried to simplify project structure to make project as easy as it possible. I believe that you find it useful.


Quick start
-----

You can try our sample application as start point.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:webpages/examples.git
cd examples/
pip install -r requirements.txt
# run server on 127.0.0.1:8000
python main.py
```

Or you can add WebPages to your existing project:

```shell
pip install webpages
```
